--5. Using split, define a function: exprs :: [ Int ] â†’ [ Expr ] that returns all expressions whose list of values is a given list. For example, exprs [1, 2, 3] should return all e for which values e = [1, 2, 3]. (24%)

data Expr = Val Int | App Op Expr Expr
data Op = Add | Sub | Mul | Div
--eg. of output: [1+2+3],[1+2*3],[1*2+3],[1*2*3] -> 6,7,5,6 respectively
